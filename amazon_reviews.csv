,"My Canary indoor cameras were constantly alerting me that our air quality was compromised. So I got this to try and see if cleaning the air would help. After setting it up and getting it going it to detected poor air quality. We have a very old house. I put it in the main living room and turned it on the highest setting and set it up for a 24 hour in the app which is super user friendly also- and even after just a few hours the air quality on both the camera and the air cleaner changed dramatically! I am pretty shocked. What on earth have we been breathing in. Lol. I love that I can control it from work and that Alexa can be connected to it, and even my Google speakers upstairs can connect to it for voice activated commands. Even if it shuts off while Im out, I can turn it back on in the app. Pretty amazing. I also like the fact that you can run it using different filters. They have the basic carbon one that comes with it, the pet one, and the mildew or chemical one. It would have been great to have a broad spectrum filter all in one to buy would be my only gripe. Id even pay more for it. But currently you have to chose which filter, so Ill buy all 3 and change them out randomly I suppose. They arent to expensive around 35 bucks and you can have them auto shipped every 6 months which is the recommended change out time, right from the app or from Amazon. Even on the highest setting it sounds like white noice. Very peaceful and not over bearing at all. Im going to get one for the other two floors we have in the house so the entire house can stay fresher. Its not heavy or bulky to carry at all. A child could carry it, yet it has a solid nice quality feel. Heavy duty plastic not cheap at all. Overall for the dollar amount spent- Im super impressed to say the least. Great product and Im looking forward to less alerts about air quality from my Canary indoor cameras!!"
,"When I opened the box, the first thing I noticed was how nice and sleek the purifier looks in person. It is a decent size but it’s heavy and it goes with my home esthetic. It is also very quiet. Unless it’s on full blast, you have to check to see if it’s actually on. That’s how quite it is. The app that syncs with the machine is also awesome. Super user friendly and the unit is quick to respond. But my most favorite aspect is the pet setting. I have 2 giant Rottweilers and one of them is a longer hair. The hair and dust they leave around my house is ridiculous. Ive only had this purifier running for a couple days and I can already tell a difference in the dust. I am so glad I made the choice to buy this."
,"Recently removed a downdraft cooktop and, rather than spend over $2k for another, decided to go ventless and buy this air purifier to remove those odors when i need it since i rarely used the downdraft anyway. Also, have never had an air purifier and really like the ease of use, ability to have charcoal filter (for odors), a HEPA filter to get the airborne pollutents and a prefilter that can be washed that will catch the dog hair. Very quiet and can be linked via Alexa to treat as any other wifi resource that can be controlled remotely. this is a larger unit that can ""treat"" over 1,000 sq. feet. Intend to buy another for upstairs."
,"My favorite part of this air purifier is how autonomous it is. The autonomous feature of the LEVOIT Air Purifier is a true standout. It constantly monitors the air quality in the room and adjusts its settings accordingly. This means that you can set it and forget it, as it effortlessly adapts to the changing needs of your living space. It's a breath of fresh air for those who value convenience. Setting up and customizing the autonomous mode is a breeze with the user-friendly interface. The LED display provides real-time air quality feedback, allowing you to monitor the purifier's performance at a glance. The LEVOIT Air Purifier's autonomous feature is a breath of fresh air in the world of air purification. It takes the hassle out of maintaining clean indoor air and ensures you and your family breathe easy day and night. With its responsive technology, quiet operation, energy efficiency, and user-friendly design, it's a stellar choice for those who demand the best in air quality and convenience. I can't recommend it highly enough."
,"I’m really happy we decided to go with this model. It’s super quiet, you can’t even tell it’s running, unless you really listen and are right up close to it. The app is updated and works seamlessly with iPhone 15. We live in a dry and dusty environment, and I’ve noticed the dust that normally covers my room has actually gone way down. I used to have to dust at least once every other week,, I actually went almost a full month since we’ve had this unit. The air seems much better now. We’re happy with the results! I like how the app lets you do everything everything even when you aren’t home. Great quality for a relatively fair price. It’s a noticeable improvement in air quality almost immediately and environmentally friendly barely using any electricity definitely another noteworthy plus. Happy customer here, I recommend it."
,"This purifier has been great so far. We have had it for over a month and it has worked perfectly. I love the washable pre-filter, which seems like it will make the HEPA filter last a lot longer. The low setting is so quiet that you can hardly hear it, which is great to use at night. The next level up is still low enough that we can have it on while watching tv and it's barely noticeable. I love that I can control it with the phone app too. I would highly recommend this item as of right now."
,I have both the round and rectangle one. I like this one the most as it is slim and fit aesthetically in the room. Very quiet and can remotely set a timer or just click it when you walk pass it.
,"I have severe allergies and been researching and trying to decide on what air purifier to get. Hepa was the main thing I was looking for. Finally settled on this one. It was an early Christmas present to myself. I got the air purifier a month ago and it’s been running in my room since. Wow what a difference so far. Before, my room always felt stale and stuffy. I tried a small cheap air purifier but it didn’t do much and wasn’t big enough for my room to really help. This levoit one is great. I love that the filters are washable and the other can be changed every 9 months or so. They even have different filter options to use, I definitely want to try to pet/allergy one next. I like that this air purifier is a smart device as that was another factor that made me choose this one. I love that I can control the air purifier from my phone, even if I’m not at home. On the app, I can see the air quality it’s detecting and it shows me the life % of the filter. I can also set reminders to tell me when to clean the filters. Can also schedule the air purifier to turn on or off, as well as the mode & there’s even a timer. On the highest mode, which would be 4 it isn’t noisy at all & can even sleep. If you’re looking for a true hepa air purifier, I highly recommend this one, especially for the price which is fairly decent compared to the more expensive ones I’ve looked at."
,The seller probably wants to kill me. I purchased 2 100s canceled one of them and up graded to 100s and a a 200s after ordereding that for the upstairs rooms I got the mini and canceled that and got the mini with extra automatic pads for the bathroom that has no windows and the cat genie. I have a cat and 2 dogs and a friend came over and the upstairs did not pass the smell test. Special area was the bathroom where the cat genie is at. My small room has black dust that forms on the ceiling fan. That room is about 12x 10 and the master is 15x20. For the master with 2 dogs I got the 200s. So the upstairs is completed. I read all the reviews and love the software on the 100s and 200s. After 3 days with the 100s I love the fresh air. The sleep mode I don’t use I just put it on auto. After cleaning I run it for an hour on fan mode 4 for an hour. Air quality is very good but I sprayed the glade air freshener on the filter for ocean breeze smell. Look forward to the let mode for the 200s. Love the hair filter that prevents the filter from getting junk in it. I have hvac that has an air filter but that shows grey dust as well. Hopefully it won’t have to be changed as often
,"I have it in the spare bathroom with my cats litter box (door is always open). As a quick warning, if you are using it next to a litter box, probably DONT use the auto feature. It detected my cats poop smell, air quality went from very good to bad and the air speed turned up and scared the crap out of my cat. Exactly what the air filter was supposed to do though, so 5 stars. And I couldn’t smell the poop! I keep it on constant 2 now and boost it when necessary. Love this product."
,I have a young puppy who is still being potty pad trained. I also live in an apartment with very back air system that allows smells from other apts. to flow into my home. This air purifier is fantastic!!! It quickly automatically escalates its cleaning process when it registers any kind of odor. Absolutely no noise. My entire apt. smells fresh and clean. Well worth it’s price.
,"Granted, it's the only brand of purifier I've ever owned. The reviews were good so I took the leap and I'm glad I did. I bought 3 of the smaller purifiers first and liked them. Then I decided I wanted something bigger to cover the downstairs and I took the smaller downstairs one to my bedroom. This one is bigger but the shape is more convenient. I just placed it at the center of the downstairs against a wall. The round ones need to be further away from the wall because the intake is 360°. This one doesn't have to be pulled away from the wall. I keep it like an inch from the wall. We live in an apartment and we have a lot of neighbors that smoke w33d and it helps when the smell seeps in. I didn't realize it detected air quality when I bought it, so when it popped up an alert on my watch, I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't notice the alert for several hours so I went and looked back at the time of the spike and it was when I was burning dinner on the stove. Lol I love that the app keeps track of everything for me. I'd never remember to change filters or anything on my own. And all 4 purifiers I've bought have great wifi connectivity. Never any issues. I've set schedules for one of them (not this one) and it always does it properly. I don't know if it's helping our health or if it's just good for smells and keeping the air fresher, but I have a child on a ventilator so this is just extra piece of mind. The HEPA filters do catch a lot of crap. They're disgusting when I change them."
,"I placed this in my kitchen. Its automatic mode keeps low airflow across its sensor and as soon as something starts getting a bit smokey on the stove, this kicks up the fan speed and clears it fast. it needs to get to level 3 or so before you even hear it. I've never seen a kitchen haze again after cooking a meal."
,This was a great addition to my other air purifier’s. It’s connected to my WiFi and easy to turn on with my phone. Removes any unwanted stale smells in the home. It is a little loud so I usually run it at night or when I am not home
,"My neighbor needs to smoke weed frequently, and the walls behind my unit's radiator have gaps that connect my unit to theirs. I purchased this air purifier to automatically detect weed odor and eliminate it whenever required. Unfortunately, it cannot detect weed odor automatically, but when I manually activate the turbo mode, I can no longer smell weed odor in my unit. So, I'm going to give it a five-star rating just because it provides a way to get rid of bad smells."
,"This is the first air purifier I've bought, and so far it seems like it's doing it's job. The house smells cleaner and I don't notice as much dust in the house or random floating pet hair (we have 3 cats and 2 dogs). It is very quiet even on higher settings (you're gonna hear the fan at full blast, but it's not super loud). The auto function seems to work well, my fiance burnt some bacon and the purifier detected poor air quality and ramped up the fan speed until it detected very good air quality. The sleep mode schedule functions as expected. The efficient air cleaning setting on auto mode says it clean 600sqft, however the product description says it will clean 1100sqft. A little misleading unless I'm not seeing the proper function. Overall a good air purifier, and I'll most likely pick up a smaller unit for our bedroom."
,I have not set up the app/wifi but I am pleased with delivery and ease of use. I've noticed a lot less dust in the air. We still have to dust the furniture 1-2 a week and vacuum daily but our main living area is a lot cleaner now. I try to shut it off when we have the windows open and I haven't changed the filter yet.
,We have 7 people and 7 dogs in Lousiana. We have had it for about a month now. I clean it 2-3 times a week.  The automatic setting doesn’t pick up on the pee smell from puppies who still go in the middle of the night on our carpet. 🙄 so I am now leaving it on #3 and haven’t had any issues. The amount of dust is way less. Before I was wiping tables and shelves down every day! Now only once a week!
,even impressed me as the amount of dust it collects. good size air intake openings. have it near tv/gaming stand since that's where most dust and pet hair wants to accumulate. noisy on higher fan speeds but what ya gonna do. ordered 2 but 1 was dead on arrival. poor quality control i guess. seems more efficient than the levoit 300 (returned)which is really loud for so little air pulling power into filter.  beware of levoit customer lack of service. they don't accept phone calls only email.  that said i'll buy more when on sale
,Works great. I got for my dog and I also have a bad habit of vaping as soon as I exhale my vape from 15ft away it picks it up and filters the air. Has a lot of modes and pet mode which I use the most. Make no noise neither.
,"I was told about this particular brand from coworkers, and after reading reviews decided to start off with the small room one then upgraded to this for pet hair and a larger combine room. It works greats. and the mobile app is also nice to have."
,"This air purifier works very well, is fairly quiet and for the price definitely worth the money. We bought 3 of the ""lower quality"" ones, which work well also. However, with the sale price this one is less, covers more area and we are very happy with this purchase! I'm sure the $600 units COULD be better but I would rather get this particular one. It works particularly well in regards to our pets. I just purchased a 2nd one for my 4yr old grandson's room. He has breathing issues at night when the propane heater clicks on. So I'm hoping this might help. ( I'll update later)."
,Bought two of these for our home; one for each floor. Easy to set up and use right out of the box. (Remember to take the plastic wrap off the filter). We can feel the difference in the air quality and couldn’t be happier with these purifiers; love them so much we are giving a few as gifts for the holidays. The air quality indicator changes immediately if we are cooking or if there is any smoke. This air purifier has also decreased the amount of dust in our home significantly! Highly recommend.
,We've had the machine for 5 days now and it's done a great job thus far. Features and app work without any issues. It responds very quickly to any changes on the app. We keep it on auto and it kicks up the moment it detects anything in the air. I can light cannabis across the room and within a minute the machine kicks up and cleans the air of smoke and odor. It does the same when cooking. A cool feature if you have kids or grandkids is you can lock the display to where they cannot change settings and you can also turn the display lights off all together. I'll probably edit this review after the filter has been changed for the first time but so far I'm pretty impressed.
,"This air purifier has helped so much. We have 2 dogs and a cat that live in the house, but you can’t smell the animals at all."
,Bought this to be placed near my cats litter box. Does a great job keeping the air clean and can't tell I have 3 cats.
,This unit is very easy to use . It fits against a wall and takes up very little space. Runs quietly. I like the color symbol that changes when air quality is less than optimal.
,"Ordered this for cyber Monday. Have been VERY impressed. We run it in our master bedroom suite that is about 1100 square feet total. Auto mode works like a charm, display turns itself off at night when we turn lights off. Most of the time when it is running, you can’t even hear it. Would 100% purchase again, and you should too."
,"When you turn on the fan a ring of light appears as soon as the fan begins recirculating air and shows one of four levels, from red meaning really poor to blue meaning very good. As I worked on years worth of accumulations in my study--archival stuff--I had stirred up enough dust and mold (and cat fur and dander) that I got a red flash and then gradually a change to blue. The air began to smell clean and I could breathe better. I got a second fan for the bedroom and I have slept better ever since I began using it. I have a third fan on order to go downstairs in an area where we sit in the evenings. The fans are portable. When need be, I put one where it is most needed. Often I will turn the bedroom fan to the ""pet"" setting. The fan slows down, gets quiet, turns on every hour or so to check air quality and runs for as long as needed. Considering the power, this is an amazingly quiet machine. I am not in the habit of recommending things ""without reservation,"" but of this Levoit fan I have no hesitation in doing so. I did not get a free machine, I am not being paid, I own no stock. But once in a while I like to share information about something that I regard as useful and pleasing. Good job, Levoit."
,"came in Levoit box all banged up with hole in one side! Seems to be working , I asked for Amazon box and did not get one. This is the second unit I have ordered in a week The first one shipped in Prime box so I will be able to ship this beat up one back if it does not work in a few days. I really like these models, I have 2 round ones which take up a lot more space to function ."
,Wanted to get an Air purifier for a while. Love this one it does all the things it’s supposed to. I would recommend it to anyone
,Easy to set up and to use. It is wonderful have clean air in my home.
,"After use this product for 3 months, It's a game-changer for our home. We have a large room, and this purifier covers the space effortlessly. The air quality and light sensors are a fantastic addition, ensuring optimal performance. The Smart WiFi feature adds a whole new level of convenience. Being able to control and monitor the air quality from my phone is a game-changer. The washable filters are not only eco-friendly but also cost-effective in the long run. The HEPA filter is a powerhouse, capturing pet hair, allergies, dust, and even smoke effectively. We've noticed a significant improvement in the air we breathe. It has truly made a positive impact on our home environment. It's a 5-star product that I highly recommend to anyone looking for a reliable and high-performing air purifier!"
,I don't even notice it running. Light weight and matches my décor.
,This product is very legit and effective; super easy to use and and definitely does it’s job. Highly recommend it.
,"I highly recommend this purifier. It has been super reliable and brings me more peace of mind. I work with some harsh resins in 3D printing and do a lot of soldering. Having this around to crank to max when I'm working with these things makes me feel a lot better. Hopefully it's actually doing something lol.  I will say, there have been a few times when searing steak/cooking that results in smoke that seems to make the purifier output the smell of wet dog. If you experience this, just wait it out. A day or two is usually all that it takes."
,"Our old machine was not working as well, been searching for another that the sound is not soft. We use this as both a filter and sound machine for white noise. It is the perfect balance for us in our room. The room is a large master bedroom and it works great, noticed my allergies are better and not as much snoring! Which is a huge plus. Highly recommend."
,Above and beyond my expectations! Totally worth the price and 100000000% recommend for any household! You won't regret it
,"I am happy I paid the extra cash for this model, it's really just solid in every category. it will clean the air very quickly in my son's room, he has nasty allergies, and it's ridiculously easy to set up schedules, and get live updates on the air quality whenever you want. installing/changing the filter is straightforward, no-nonsense, and the washable prefilter is great because it extends the life of the filter by keeping the dog hair, etc. out of it. This thing is just a very well thought out piece of equipment, we'll likely buy several more for other rooms in the house. Strongly recommend."
,Quiet and has a sensor that detects bad air and comes on automatically. Use around my cats’ litter box.
,We like that it seems to work and it is quieter than are old one! We didn't do the phone app part of it. We feel it's unnecessary. We just bought a second one for our second floor!  DW
,We have it in where our 2 dogs sleep and it does an outstanding job collecting dog hair and controlling the smell
,I love this thing. It’s just the right size to not get in the way but have good surface area for air intake. I have had it on auto mode and it’s done a great job of detecting the air changing (I go over to blow smoke near it just to watch it work). You can dim the lights for night and do everything right on the unit but I am the most in love with the app. My daughter is 3 and autistic and cannot resist messing with anything that lights up and has buttons - with the app I can set the purifier how I want it and LOCK THE CONTROLS so she she look at the lights and touch it all she wants without changing anything or shutting it off. It might seem small to some people but for our home this is game changing!
,It's a really nice air filter. I could always wish it was cheaper but honestly it is doing everything I ex[pected.
,Great product love the app integration
,One of my favorite HEPA systems for a Very Fast Improvement. All 3 digital meters show a drastic improvement within 20 minutes. All 3 are measuring @ best recordable air quality to this day.
,I love this air purifier it works amazing . I didnt realize it has 3 filters not just one . i like the app that comes with it as well . Great product and not too expensive
,"Using this in my 1400 sq ft home and it works great! It can sense dust, aerosol sprays, etc from another room and the auto mode will kick in. It's pretty quiet most of the time and doesn't interrupt sleep when placed in bedroom. I also love that you can control it by app. Also the filter is super easy to clean and replace!"
,"First of all - this is the fourth single-room intended air filter I've bought in the last year. The other 3, one was another Levoit, a white round one that is about as tall as this one, to sit behind my two monitors on my desk. The other two are by Airtok, half as tall as the Levoit, black and round as well. I am not dissatisfied with any of them, but the round design on the other 3 was proving just a bit too space consuming so I was looking for a slimmer design. This Levoit design is perfect and meets that needs. BUT THEN! holy cow - everything else about the Smart Vital 100s is amaaaaazing! I knew it was bluetooth/wifi enabled and came with an app for remote connectivity, but I had no idea it was going to be so easy to setup and manage!! From box open to first run - about 3 minutes to complete the setup. No tools needed, no difficult to open packaging - just removal of some protective plastic wrapping and about 20 seconds to setup the app. It measures the air quality automagically - and after having completed that setup yesterday around 8pm, it has come on AUTOMAGICALLY and cleaned the air 5 times without me having to do anything. The app gives a report of the air monitoring, detection, cleaning, etc. It's 11am now the next morning and its already done more for me on its own that the other systems ever did. And on it's own. Love it. The app deserves it own entire review because it is far more than I expected it to be. I assumed it would be a basic bluetooth management app, basically to turn the system on/off. But seriously it's wild. Wellness sections, air quality during sleep modes, quality triggers, alert management, schedules for different control settings at different times, device controls for different rooms and all that stuff for each device. They really put thought and time into the app. Warranty management and part ordering from the app as well. It's like the Echo device management in Alexa app, or the HP Smart app- you can pretty much do everything you need and more from inside the VeSync app. It looks sharp, too. Very tech, smooth, minimal design - all controls on top with LED touch control. Smart smart smart. I am totally happy with this purchase. The only possible improvement they could make would be the same feedback the world has on any of these small appliance devices - universal power cabling would be great. Then I could get whatever length power cable I needed for whatever room. But that's true for all sorts of things like desk fans, coffee makers, etc etc. SO that's not really on Levoit and that's what power strips are for. But literally that's all I could possible think of. Everything about this is easy easy easy and smart."
," You must buy this product. Just look at my pictures/videos.  Some details: I bought this back in May, We have a 1200ish ft. home. It’s placed in the middle of the hallway. We have three dogs.  I mainly got it because the house that we moved into had a weird, stuffy smell, and on top of that with my dogs being indoor/outdoor, so I needed some kind of air purification. The purifier has an app which works great (it tells you how much filter life you have and you can turn it on/off from anywhere). The pictures attached are the first time I ever change the filter… which I SHOULD HAVE actually read the instructions because it says you have to clean the top filter every 2 to 4 months so the actual filter could last longer… as you can see I did mine at 6 months. Oops! Haha. It was so easy to clean and honestly pretty shocking of how much hair and dust it’s collected in 6 months. I loved the product so much i bought another one for my mom as she was suffering from a lingering cough.  After a week you do feel a difference in the air, much cleaner and easier to breathe. I highly recommend."
,"Love this little thing so much I'm buying a 2nd one to replace the old purifier I have for my bedroom. The one I currently have is in my living room and it works like a charm. The washable prefilter keeps all the pet hair out of the heap filter. And the different varieties of HEPA filters you can buy means you can choose your level of filtration. I have allergies to just about everything, so I buy the highest grade. The other benefit is that it's QUIET. Even on full fan speed, it's quieter than my tower fan. Highly recommend."
,"A family member needed this way more than I did so I set it up in their home. They have many shredding rabbits and was in need or it. The rabbits like it too. But I do miss my air purifier but sometimes you have to give up nice things to help orders. I go over there house to clean it and check on it weekly, I have to force myself not to pick it up and take it back home with me. But when I see all those bunnies I get back to my senses and know why I took it there in the 1st place. It really pulls in a lot of pet fur too. It works very well. It has low to high settings and even a pet setting that’s not too high of a speed. The color scheme shows different colors for different air qualities levels. The app controls are even better. It can be controlled away from home too , and even can be turned on / off from the app too INFACT all functions can work from the app as well as manually. So it’s just well put together."
,"This unit is great. I haven’t had to do it yet, but the filters are washable. The rectangular shape makes it easy to fit into different spaces. I also love the air quality gauge… red means the air n Ed’s major cleaning (such as sfter cooking a steak) through yellow, green and finally blue when the air is clean. This means I can turn it off and save electricity"
,Easy to use and does an excellent job of cleaning the air! We now sleep through the night!
,"Size is good. It takes a little bit to clear odors, but it does it. It's very quiet. It was easy to unpack and set up. It's light-weight. The buttons on the top are easy to use. It shuts itself off when the job is done. It's a good value. I can be in a room without being noticed. I've had it for a few months now. I didn't set up the phone app yet. I use the top buttons quicky to turn it on to run for two hours, and the circle will be red when I think it should be, and then it clears the air, and the circle turns white again."
,"I love these products, I had the smaller unit and bought the bigger for a lager room, The app is perfect as the unit itself."
,My house smells musty from basement. I spent $4K waterproofing my basement but upstairs still smell musty. I purchased this hoping it would work on musty/ not just allergens. It definitely worked but I put on forced high fan for a week to get smell out (automatic setting did not turn on since it didn’t recognize musty as bad air quality).
,I love everything about this AP.
,"It does a good job with dog hair and dust. It doesn't get rid of it all, but does make a difference. I am very pleased."
,This is my second levoit birthday hard to understand why the app doesnt show the indoor price as a numerical value the same basis on my model 300. It's the same app.
,We got 2 of these for our old home. They seem to work well after a faulty one was replaced. I like the app integration and the fact that I can control them with our digital personal assistant of choice. The prefilter is easy to clean and the main filter is easy to replace.
,Smartly designed. Low noise. Auto mode kicks in and sucks up cooking smoke. App is convenient.
,"Quiet sound, compact, easy setup not sure it really can filter Air Force 800sq ft apartment though product description says:1110 square feet. May order another one just for my bedroom depending how the unit performs."
,"Been using this for a couple months and it does a great great job purifying the air…when it’s on. Bought this when we got a couple of kittens and my allergies were struggling. Loved that it has a display lock feature. Problem is that when a kitten jumps up on it, they can still somehow turn it off. The app makes it sound like if you turn on the display lock from within the app, buttons are disabled. Not true. So frustrating that the kittens will turn it off and I won’t find out about it until the next morning and when on high power the fan is a little loud for conference calls."
,Works great I would recommend
,"All I wanted is a quality air purifier that is affordable and yet quiet 🤫. I think I found a winner. My sleep is much better now that I put the noisier one in the living room, which is a bonus since it gives me better air through out my apartment. Would definitely recommend."
,"For the price, this thing is great. Gets rid of cigar smoke well. On automatic, I don't think it really detects smoke and turns on, so I leave it on all the time. Easy to install and to clean filters. Very quiet."
,"My home is dusty and then I decided to add 5 dogs, so the dust and dirt that flies around is insane! I had a different purifier and it didn’t do much so then I decided to try this one and it works so well, I am impressed!"
,"This thing works great. It's barely audible in automatic mode, and will sometimes detect things like pet hair and spool up to a louder thrum until things are good again. I like the Core 200s slightly better because of the more sensitive air quality meter, but I like this one slightly better because of the form factor that fits tightly against a wall. They sound about the same and clean about the same --- maybe 25-26 dB in quiet mode (not quite down to the 22 db they advertise). Filters are expensive, but good filters are always expensive."
,Excellent investment
,The air purifier seems to work. Has not really read anything buy very good.
,Like the compact yet powerful purifier. This is our second and it runs quiet
,This air purifier is great! It automatically sucks up any odor particles from our 3 litter boxes or even a large cigar. The app tells you when the air quality has lowered and will purify the air automatically and quickly. Not to mention it is whisper quiet. The app is extremely helpful in many ways. I’ve lost 2 lbs with the wellness/diet part of the VeSync App. You have to try this for yourself.
,Exactly what I needed for the space. Like the automatic setting and sensors indicate when air is dirty. Quiet and works well.
,I have this one in the bedroom. I have carpet and it gets dusty with my allergies it is great. Having the ability to adjust how I want it to run and when is so wonderful. Definitely my choice for years to come.
,I don't do a lot of reviews but this thing is amazing. It is efficient and if you set it on auto it takes care of itself. it even gives me notifications when the air is dirty and its turning up and when its clean and turning down. I have one in my bedroom and one in my daughter's bedroom and I am so glad that I bought these. Oh I also have a humidifier by the same brand and it is great too. Keep up the great work Levoit!
,im using it in my basement...to clean up the musky air.. it only been a month but it quiet and odorless.
,"I have a different Levoit purifier in my bedroom that I love and I wanted a secondary unit for the litter box area for my cat. This model seemed like the perfect fit because I only needed the purifier to service a small area and the auto feature sounded like it would effectively target the daily litter clouds from scooping. My expectations were met! This unit operates at a low level all day and then as soon as I scoop the litter box, the ring on the 100S turns red and quickly sucks up all the dust in the air. I noticed it comes on when I am cooking anything that produces smoke and helps to prevent the house from holding the smell. Overall I am very impressed with this product!"
,"Works great! Love the color indicators, isn’t too large and love the night mode"
,Fast love the app
,"I bought this for mom for Christmas, but gave it to her early. She loves it because she wakes up without any sinus issues. That hasn't happened for her in a very long time. I have a de-humidifier from LeVoit, so I knew that I was giving her a top-quality item."
,"It took 15mins to setup all of it via the app, very user-friendly indeed.  It's placed near kitchen area so the fan kicks off when there's cooking event happening. You'd get an alert when it's ON and when the air is cleared.  Buttons on the unit are easy to read and press, and very simple.  App indicates how much life is left on your filter base on your usage and date installed, convenient. Some other basic historical metrics that shows you when it was ON vs OFF.  If you live in Illinois ComEd you are eligible for a $50 rebate for this model since this is Energy Star certified. As I've received a rebate check it's definitely legit and makes this unit so much more affordable."
,"I gave this 4 stars only because I haven’t received my electric bill yet to know how energy efficient it is. I have mine sitting on my dining table because it’s the center space of the main unwanted air gathering. Of course will move it if visitors are here. It has a nice style, easy to use, does have activated charcoal filter & removes odors, dust & other quickly. It removes some of fumes coming through from neighbors apt slowly. There is a difference between smokey air & fumes from other stuff. There is a difference. This air purifier has really been working hard to get the job done. It’s been 2 weeks of 24/7 at different times. I can handle the high speed noise easily when awake. It isn’t too loud, quieter than a box fan for sure. When the electric bill arrives I’ll know if can give this purifier the 5th star."
,"There is construction going on across the hall from me in my building so I figured it was time to invest in one of these - and I’m so happy I got this one!  As this apt was newly renovated when we moved in, it still smelt a bit like construction (not to mention it really did in the hallway). Not only has it made the smell go away, but the air also feels so much clearer! (And there’s a big jump from the common hallway to inside our place).  The app works seamlessly and customer service has been great! I got an error when trying to initiate the warranty, but apparently they come with it already set up now!  Highly recommend. Works well for cooking in a small space as well"
,We are very happy with this purchase. It works great to keep the air clean & fresh. Really like being able to monitor the air quality thru an APP while away.
,Works great
,Links with my Google and I can set it up on a timer
,"I absolutely love this purifier. The ease of use ,being able o access it through my phone is great! Just had a friend visit and she saw it and ordered her one !!  Dianne"
,"I love the fact I can set this to a schedule and never have to worry about turning on or off. The app works perfect! Even alerts if low air quality… Still trying to figure out if helping my allergies, they seem somewhat better…time will tell."
,"First off, I would like to say that this purifier works incredibly well, and is extremely quiet even at the highest setting. I definitely expected it to be much louder, but you could run it in a bedroom with virtually no disruption, which was a very nice bonus for me as I hate the sound of fans.  The design is very simple to understand and removing the old filter and replacing it with a new one will be a very quick process.  I bought it because I have cats and I wanted the pet smell to be removed when I arrived home and I was not disappointed. This thing removed the smell of everything in my apartment however, with that being said, this will have to be moved from room to room in order to effectively cleanse the air in each space. Despite the range this has, leaving it in one location and expecting it to preform to its best ability would take quite awhile for it to properly eliminate all of the old “dirty air” in the entirety of your living areas so I would definitely suggest changing the placement for best results. As with most air purifiers, this one will remove the smell of candles and essential oils so keep in mind to burn or run those when the purifier is turned off.  Overall the setup was quick and easy and I will absolutely purchase another one."
,"I love that there is an app and you can clean the filter along with the app giving you access to a variety of health improvements such as fasting, it will count your steps, etc. very cool! I like how small it is, but I don’t like how small it is. It’s nice cuz it doesn’t take up too much room but I’m surprised that that small device can clean the air so quickly. Over all would buy again and I also have the same branded one for my room! Works great"
,"I love being able to schedule times for it to come on and also autodetect to keep my air quality at its best! The app is so easy to use and really makes a difference. My apartment is definitely fresher smelling and with my cat, the hair is picked up from the air quickly."
,"When my husband got diagnosed with an allergy to dogs, we had a problem, in that we have eight dogs. His doctor told him to not let the dogs upstairs (we laughed). Then he suggested not letting the dogs in our bedroom (more laughter). His last suggestion was to not let the dogs on our bed. You guessed it, more laughter. So we did what we could, resolved to change the sheets twice a week, and bought an air purifier for the bedroom. This little machine is fantastic! You set it up with an app, and it just works. You don't have to turn it on or off, or adjust anything, ever. It also hooks up to Alexa. It detects the air quality and adjusts its fan speed automatically. About a month ago we suffered through a few days of really bad outside air. Everyone was advised to stay inside and keep the windows closed. Well, that little air purifier told us that the little bit of air that was getting in was bad. The light on the top went red and the fan went on high, on and off for the rest of the day. I get air quality notifications on my phone. I love this thing, and would happily buy one for every room in the house! UPDATE: we bought another one for our Family Room!!"
,"I was skeptical at first when I bought this but I absolutely love it. The app is super easy to use and control the unit, we love the feedback it gives and how it auto adjusts and quickly refreshes the air."
,"We moved in to a older farm home and have done lots of remodeling but at the end of the day there is still a lot of allergens in the air. Family of 5 with 2 dogs, country dirt, Oregon wildfire smoke and outrageous pollen counts these really help. I notice a difference in how I feel.  I have a child that is hypersensitive to smell. So much so that he will get sick and vomit from the smell of certain meat cooking. I am an overstimulated mom who struggles with the sound of kitchen fan on continuously. This has been a sanity saver I’m out home. It auto turns on when someone is cooking in the kitchen and help get rid of smells well enough that my kiddo can join us at the table for dinner"
,"I WISH I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED THIS SOONER. I have a dog, guinea pig's, and bunnies in my little 1100 SQ FT apartment. I am VERY OCD and can't do smells, at all. I quickly realized after adding my free roam bunnies to the mix, that their litter boxes are not fresh smelling...and I can't handle that. So to amazon I ran. I bought this after browsing for some time and reading countless reviews. This one is WELL WORTH THE MONEY. As soon as it arrived, I set it up and downloaded the app. I love that you can set it up on an auto timer. My house smells so fresh. I get compliments often on how many animals I have but it doesn't ""smell like it"". BEST COMPLIMENT EVER. You can also view the filter life % and order your filter based off that %. I've had mine for OVER a month... and it is STILL GOING STRONG. The filter still has 75% life left in it...and it runs about 18 / 19 hours a day. This things is amazing!!"
,"Ordered one of these for my office due to allergens and dust. It's quiet and I often forget that it's here and on. The pre-filter is wonderful as there is a cat in my office and it sheds quite a bit, so this catches the fur before it can clog up the HEPA filter. The app makes it easy to set up a schedule to automatically turn it on and off. I've been breathing easier since I got it and a persistent cough that I had has ceased. I liked the one in my office so much, I ordered another for my house!"
,"I have two of these and I am very pleased. It notifies me when air quality changes and using the app is a breeze. Lightweight, easy to move around. Easy to set up. Best investment for my home health."
,"I replaced 2 Guardian Air purifiers that had run their course. I have been pleasantly surprised by these. They're light, the cords are nice and long, I can position them right against the wall, they're quite, easy to understand. I connected mine to my Google Home app so I can ask Google to change fan speeds. I spent the first couple weeks skeptical because I didn't see the Air quality change from ''very good."" I moved one of them downstairs to my pet area. When I was sweeping and moving things around I noticed the lights change color to indicate a drop in air quality. Even then I was skeptical and thought, 'well of course the Air quality is lower when I kick up dust.' But then I noticed that when my big fluffy dog gets uppity, hopping around, tail wagging, the air quality changes too. Super cool. If I could change one thing I'd like to see the history of air quality in the app. My only regret is not buying the high quality purifier from the same brand."
,This is by far the best air purifier that I had bought . Love that it’s also Bluetooth so you can adjust it from your phone instead of manually turning it off . My husband smokes in the garage and sometimes the smoke comes inside the house but with this I don’t ever smell the cigarette smell anymore .
